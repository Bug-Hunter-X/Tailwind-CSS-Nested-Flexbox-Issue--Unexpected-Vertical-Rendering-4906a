```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This is a red div.
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This is a blue div.
  </div>
</div>
```
By default, `flex` creates a row.  However, if the parent div also has default styling that impacts it (such as a default height), it may require additional styling. This example doesn't need any extra changes to the existing code to produce the desired behavior.
