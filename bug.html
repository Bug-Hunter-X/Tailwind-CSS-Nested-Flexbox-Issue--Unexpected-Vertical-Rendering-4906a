```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This is a red div.
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This is a blue div.
  </div>
</div>
```
This code produces unexpected behavior when using Tailwind's `flex` utility. The red div is rendered correctly, but the blue div is rendered *below* the red div, not beside it as expected. This is due to a common misunderstanding in how Tailwind's `flex` utility works, especially within nested structures.
